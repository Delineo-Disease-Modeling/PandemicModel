        households ('H'), schools ('S'), and workplaces ('W'), and long term care facilities ('LTCF'). Contacts in these layers are clustered and thus form a network composed of
        groups of people interacting with each other. For example, all household members are contacts of each other, and everyone in the
        same school is considered a contact of each other. If use_two_group_reduction is True, then contracts within 'LTCF' are reduced
