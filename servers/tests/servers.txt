Steps to running servers:
1) run "npm install" in PandemicModel (main folder)
2) "cd servers"
3) "node website.js" (in one terminal, runs website.js server)
4) "node simulator.js" (in second terminal)
5) Go to "localhost:3000" (expect to see only a note on the page)
6) return to terminals to see server interaction via console logs
    and check folder for new json creation

Unity server -> makes request to simulator (passes user data json)
then simulator passes back JSON (different file, visual version of data) 
to unity game to start game.

Testing: python -> outputs JSON data to a file
get json data file then return it (response, perhaps 
listen for post/get request)
