                be necessary when your age mixing matrix and the population you are interested in modeling differ in
                important but subtle ways. For example, generally household age mixing matrices reflect mixing patterns

                college or university aged individuals living together. Without this customization, this algorithm tends
                to under produce young adults. This method also has a tendency to underproduce the elderly, and does not
                explicitly model the elderly living in nursing homes. Customizations like this should be considered in
                context of the specific population and culture you are trying to model. In some cultures, it is common to
                live in non-family households, while in others family households are the most common and include
                multi-generational family households. If you are unsure of how to proceed with customizations please
